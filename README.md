Useful tools for Data Science, Data Analysis and Data Processing. Mostly this means snippets of code (mostly Python) for building data pipelines and notebooks (Jupyter and Colab oriented).

The repo serves as a toolbox/library of functions so that one can avoid rewriting snippets of code and reinventing the wheel.

I think about the possibility of turning some of them into an importable library in the future, especially when the repo grows.
